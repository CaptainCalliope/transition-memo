# Transition Memo

The Transition Team for the new mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, reached out to me for guidance on civic technology and open data.

## This is the tentative response, still being edited.

[Harlan Weber](http://github.com/whereshj) is a major contributor.

View `transition-memo.md` in your own markdown editor, or raw. GitHub-flavored Markdown does weird things to the formatting.

[The online Markdown editor Dillinger displays everything perfectly.](http://dillinger.io/) Copy and paste the raw `transition-memo.md` into that.

If you use [Marked](http://markedapp.com/), change the CSS (bottom left) to Custom CSS Example.
