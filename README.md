# Transition Memo

The Transition Team for the new mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh, reached out to me for guidance on civic technology and open data.

## This is the tentative response, still being edited.

The final memo has not yet been submitted. Our contact on the transition team will let us know when it is being finalized.

### Authorship

[Harlan Weber](http://github.com/whereshj) is a major contributor.

### Viewing

View `transition-memo.md` in your own markdown editor, or raw. GitHub-flavored Markdown does weird things to the formatting.

[The online Markdown editor Dillinger displays everything perfectly.](http://dillinger.io/) Copy and paste the raw `transition-memo.md` into that.

If you use [Marked](http://markedapp.com/), change the CSS (bottom left) to Custom CSS Example.

### Making Changes

Edit `transition-memo.md` in the `master` branch. After pulling, I'll update `index.html` on `gh-pages`.
