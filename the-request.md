I'm not working with civic data on a day to day basis - so I wanted to check in with practitioners to make sure that I bring relevant issues to the table.

We've been posed with a common question, with a request that each person be prepared to offer one or two ideas or answers that address each of three scenarios. These scenarios are Keep, Implement and Dream.


Keep is something that the city is already doing that should be maintained.

Implement is an idea/policy that the city is not currently doing and which could be realized without major new funding or legislative changes.

Dream is an idea/policy that could be transformative but will require a longer time horizon. We are encouraged to be concise but specific in answers:

I'll have to tell how the idea/policy works
cite models locally or elsewhere, if applicable, and point out the most compelling evidence.
This structure will set out contours for the discussion and the final deliverable, which is a brief report of perhaps 5 to 8 pages.


Within this framework, is there anything you can think of that the city can do more of / differently / work towards that will help you in your work?  I know the New Urban Mechanics people well - and I am very supportive - it will be a strong Keep.  Is there anyone you think I should contact as well?
